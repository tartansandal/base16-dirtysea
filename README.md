# base16-dirtysea-scheme

A color scheme for [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).

Dark themes look good and feel good on the eyes, but if you have to switch back
and forth to a web browser during your normal work, they can end up causing more
eye-strain. This is my attempt at a low-saturation, hight-contrast palette on
a grey background. The contrast between the grey background and the white
background of most websites is less jarring. Moreover, the grey background is
much less susceptible to glare than dark backgrounds.
