# base16-dirtysea-scheme

A color scheme for [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).

Dark themes look good and feel good on the eyes. If you have to switch back and
forth to a web browser during your normal work, though, they can end up causing
even more eye-strain, because most websites use a light theme.

This is my attempt at a low-saturation, hight-contrast on a grey background. The
contrast between the grey background and the white background of most websites
is less jarring. Moreover, the grey background is much less susceptible to glare
than dark backgrounds.
